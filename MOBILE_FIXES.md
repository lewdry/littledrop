# Mobile Fixes Documentation

This document describes the fixes implemented to improve the mobile experience of Littledrop.

## 1. Audio Reliability on Mobile

### Problem
The ripple sound was unreliable on mobile devices. Users needed to toggle mute on/off, toggle the phone's silent mode, or click directly on the player waterdrop to make the sound work.

### Solution
Implemented multiple strategies to ensure audio plays reliably on mobile:

#### Changes Made:
1. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks to all audio initialization and playback methods
2. **Async Audio Methods**: Made `resume()`, `playXylophoneNote()`, and `playCollisionSound()` async to properly await audio context resumption
3. **Aggressive Resume Strategy**: Audio context is now resumed:
   - Before every sound playback
   - On every user interaction (touch, click, UI button press)
   - State is checked before attempting to play sounds
4. **UI Button Integration**: Both pause and mute buttons now trigger audio context initialization/resumption
5. **State Verification**: Before playing sounds, the code verifies that:
   - Audio context exists
   - Audio context is in 'running' state
   - Audio is not muted

### Implementation Details:
- `AudioManager.init()`: Wrapped in try-catch for better error handling
- `AudioManager.resume()`: Made async, attempts to resume suspended audio context
- `AudioManager.playXylophoneNote()`: Calls `resume()` before playing, with state verification
- `AudioManager.playCollisionSound()`: Calls `resume()` before playing, with state verification
- `setupUI()`: Both pause and mute buttons now call `audioManager.resume()`
- `onDown()`: Made async and awaits `audioManager.resume()` before creating ripples to ensure audio context is fully initialized before playing sounds
- UI button handlers: Made async and await `audioManager.resume()` to properly initialize audio context

## 2. Mobile Zoom Level

### Problem
On mobile, the canvas was too zoomed in by default, with rarely any elements visible in the default zoom window. The user wanted the ability to adjust the default zoom level for mobile (portrait) orientation.

### Solution
Implemented a configurable zoom factor that automatically applies to mobile devices in portrait orientation.

#### Changes Made:
1. **Zoom Configuration Variable**: Added `this.mobileZoomFactor = 0.5` in the `LittledropGame` constructor
   - Default value of 0.5 means 2x zoom out (see twice as much of the world)
   - Can be easily adjusted by changing this single variable
   - Higher values = more zoomed out
   - Lower values = more zoomed in

2. **Mobile Detection**: Detects portrait orientation by checking if `window.innerHeight > window.innerWidth`
   - Note: This simple heuristic also triggers on desktop browsers in narrow windows
   - This is acceptable as the zoom helps in any narrow viewport scenario

3. **Zoom Application**: Applied in three key areas:
   - **Rendering**: Transform applied in `render()` method using `ctx.scale(zoomScale, zoomScale)`
   - **Input Handling**: Touch/mouse coordinates converted to world space accounting for zoom
   - **Camera Bounds**: Camera clamping adjusted to account for zoomed viewport

### Implementation Details:
- `constructor()`: Added `mobileZoomFactor` variable with documentation in the `LittledropGame` class
- `render()`: Detects mobile orientation and applies zoom transform to canvas
- `setupInput()`: Updates `getPointer()` to convert screen coordinates to world coordinates with zoom factor
- `update()`: Updates camera bounds clamping to account for zoom

### How to Adjust Zoom:
To experiment with different zoom levels, simply change the `mobileZoomFactor` value in the `LittledropGame` constructor:
```javascript
// Search for 'mobileZoomFactor' in App.svelte
this.mobileZoomFactor = 0.5;  // Try values between 0.3 (very zoomed out) and 1.0 (no zoom)
```

Recommended values:
- `0.5` - Default (2x zoom out, good balance)
- `0.4` - 2.5x zoom out (see much more)
- `0.6` - 1.67x zoom out (slightly less aggressive)
- `1.0` - No zoom (original behavior)

## Testing Recommendations

### Audio Testing:
1. Test on iOS Safari and Chrome
2. Test on Android Chrome
3. Verify sounds play on first touch/interaction
4. Verify sounds continue to work after toggling mute
5. Check console for any audio errors

### Zoom Testing:
1. Test in portrait orientation on mobile
2. Verify elements are visible in initial view
3. Test touch input accuracy (can you touch what you intend to?)
4. Verify camera follows player correctly
5. Experiment with different `mobileZoomFactor` values to find optimal setting
